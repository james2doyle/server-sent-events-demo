> A demo showing how server-sent events work

### Server Sent Events

If you want to know more about server-sent events, check out [this article on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events).

If you want to read the specification for server-sent events, [you can go to the page on the whatwg site](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html).

### Setup

Just have a local version of PHP installed. If you have [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/valet), that will also work.
